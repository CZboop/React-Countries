# React Countries  

BNTA bootcamp project, creating a React app connected to the REST Countries API.  
Built a website with an interactive, map-style interface. Map buttons open a modal to show countries by continent, and users have the ability to select countries they have visited, which can then also be viewed in their own scrollable modal.

Pair programmed between @helboi4 and @CZboop
